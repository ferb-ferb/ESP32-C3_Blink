# ESP32-C3 Blink
This repo contains all of the code that I wrote in learning how to flash a program to an ESP32-C3
that I got off of Alixpress for free, lol. 

Some topics that this small project exhibits include <br />
**Embedded Systems Development**<br />
- Microcontroller Programming
- Memory-mapped I/O 
**RTOS**  <br />
- FreeRTOS task management and scheduling
- vTaskDelay() 
- Interrupt Handling 
**Professional Toolchain**   <br />
- ESP-IDF Framework
- CMake Configuration
**Computer Architecture**  <br />
- RISC-V Architecture 
- Real-time operating system concepts

In the end, this project was meant to get me started in practicing concepts of low-level
programming and toolchains because I want to get started with ARM Developer Labs projects.
ESP32 doesn't use ARM processors but the concepts are similar and good for practice (it's what I had layign around).
